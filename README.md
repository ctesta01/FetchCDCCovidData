# Fetch Covid-19 Data from the data.cdc.gov API using RSocrata

Within this repository, there is an Rmarkdown document (fetch_cdc_covid_data.Rmd)
that shows an example of how to call the data.cdc.gov API to retrieve 
covid-19 related outcomes broken down by race and hispanic origin, state,
and age groups. 

The data is retrieved using the documentation here: 

> Deaths involving coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by race and Hispanic origin group and age, by state
> <https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.cdc.gov/ks3g-spdg>
